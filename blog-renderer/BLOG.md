This is my first blog. In the future I will add a description of how this blog will work, and how it gets updated. But as of right now, not all of the features are there. Below is a checkbox list of what is done, and what I need to do:

- [X] implement custom markdown rendering
- [X] create script that can detect BLOG.md files from git commit history
- [X] output files with "nice" styling
- [X] add basic SEO tags
- [ ] make it open source
- [ ] write about how it works
- [ ] implement tag system
- [X] center images
- [ ] more...
